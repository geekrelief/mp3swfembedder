mp3_embedder: Don-Duong Quach (c) 2009

requires: haxe and neko http://www.haxe.org

run: "haxe compile.hxml" to build the embed tool which stores an mp3 into a swf usable
by Actionscript 3 for dynamic loading of an embedded Sound instance.

embed relies on swfmill with mp3 support here: http://github.com/mental/swfmill/tree/master

the embed tool produces a swf from an input mp3

You can see a sample of how to use the swf in the sample folder.
run: 
cd sample
../embed 1.mp3
haxe compile.hxml

open dynload.swf which dynamically loads 1.swf

Tested on Ubuntu 8.10
